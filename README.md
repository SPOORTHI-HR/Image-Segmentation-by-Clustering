# Image-Segmentation-by-Clustering
The project focuses on image segmentation using clustering techniques. The main goal is to divide an image into meaningful segments based on pixel characteristics such as color, intensity, or texture. The project uses K-means clustering to achieve this.

Key Components
Libraries Used:

cv2 (OpenCV): For image processing.

numpy: For numerical operations.

matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing images.

Steps Involved:

Reading the Image: The image is read using OpenCV and converted to RGB format.

Reshaping the Image: The image is reshaped into a 2D array of pixels.

K-means Clustering: K-means clustering is applied to segment the image into different clusters.

Displaying Results: The original and segmented images are displayed using Matplotlib.

Finding Optimal K-value:

The project includes a method to find the optimal number of clusters (K) using the Elbow method.

Methodology
Reading the Image: The image is read using OpenCV and converted to RGB format.

Reshaping the Image: The image is reshaped into a 2D array of pixels.

K-means Clustering: K-means clustering is applied to segment the image into different clusters.

Finding Optimal K-value: The Elbow method is used to find the optimal number of clusters (K).
